# Word-Etymology

Wiktionary webscraper that returns information about a word in a language. Currently it webscrapes for etymology, IPA pronunciation, and definition.
A console IO can be accessed by running main.py.

Planned future additions include a GUI and further scraping on Wiktionary to show a list of cognates for a given word.
